Most of my programming experiences derive from programming assignments from classes taken at UCSD. However, I used this past summer to strengthen my coding background by learning new languages and creating some applications in my spare time. A couple of examples are:
- Scientific Calculator
- Stock Price Tracker
- Youtube Search client
  
#### Current Goals
- [ ]  Get a Full-Time Job
- [ ]  Travel abroad to new countries
- [ ]  Graduate from UCSD
